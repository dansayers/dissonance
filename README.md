dissonance

The root directory is the web root folder. This was designed to run under an apache web server with PHP >=5.2.

Inside the dissonance folder is the C code (dissonance.c) that needs to be compiled to the binary dissonance on the machine running the web server.

Within the ga folder is some code for running a genetic algorithm to minimise overall roughness for simultaneous notes within an octave. It's pretty much experimental.
